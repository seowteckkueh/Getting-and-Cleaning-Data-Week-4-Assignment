## Activity Labels

Subject column is numbered sequentially from 1 to 30. activitylabel column has 6 types as listed below.
1. WALKING: Subject was walking during the test
2. WALKING_UPSTAIRS: Subject was walking up a staircase during the test
3. WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS: Subject was walking down a staircase during the test
4. SITTING：Subject was sitting during the test
5. STANDING：Subject was standing during the test
6. LAYING：Subject was laying down during the test

### Variables in the tidy.txt
tidy.txt contains the tidy data which has a dimension of 180 rows and 68 columns. Each row has the observation for the averaged variables of each subject(subject) and each activity(activitylabel).
Only the variables estimated from mean and standard deviation in the were kept.

* mean(): Mean value
* std(): Standard deviation
